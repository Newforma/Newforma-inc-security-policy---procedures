## 2. POLICY STANDARDS 

Information security is the preservation of confidentiality, integrity and availability of Newforma information. It may also include 
the authenticity, accountability, non-repudiation and reliability of Newforma information depending on the circumstances. 

Information risk means the risks to the security of Newforma’s information.

### 2.1 	Objectives: 

2.1.1 Newforma requires the security of its information to be maintained in order to ensure that Newforma is able to rely on its information for its 
business needs and meets its statutory, regulatory and governmental policy obligations.

consistent with this standard.

the Newforma’s senior management team in conjunction with guidance from the Information Security representative, to specific categories of risk levels 
that have  been agreed upon. (i.e.; Very Low, Low, Medium, High, and Very High)

* U.S. Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA)
* EU General Data Protection Regulation (in conjunction with Privacy Shield) 
* All applicable State Privacy and Security Laws (e.g.; New Hampshire, Texas)
* Homeland Security Act (HSA)

2.3.2 	Newforma is required to comply with United states and international laws based on being an international company and housing PII and other 
types of data that requires a formal Information Security Management System to secure the data.

policy and regulatory obligations are met.

2.3.4 	Any processing of personal data outside the United States may not take place without the express permission of Newforma’s Senior Legal / Privacy 
representative, in conjunction with senior management, and prior to the commencement of any such processing. Arrangements for data processing will form 
part of a contract between Newforma and data processors. 

2.3.5  Any prorcessing of perosanal data in the EU that would lead to the data leaving the EU may not take place without express premission of Newforma's Sernior
Legal / Privacy representative, in conjunction with senior management, and prior to the commencement of any such processing. Arrangements for data processing will form 
part of a contract between Newforma and data processors.
