A. After receiving your PII, we will store it on our servers for future use. We have physical, electronic, and managerial procedures in place to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use the information we collect. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or data storage solution can ever be completely secure. As a result, although we take industry-standard steps to protect your information (e.g., strong encryption), we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to or receive from us or that we store on our or our service providers' systems.

B. If you are accessing the Service from outside of the US, you understand that your connection will be through and to servers located in the US, and the information you provide will be securely stored in our servers and internal systems located within the US.

\8. How Do We Use Cookies And Other Network Technologies?

A. To enhance your online experience with us, our web pages may use "cookies." Cookies are text files that our web server may place on your hard disk to store your preferences. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your PII unless you choose to provide this information to us. Once you choose to provide PII, however, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie. Certain features of the Service may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

B. Newforma or our service providers may also use "pixel tags," "web beacons," "clear GIFs," or similar means (collectively, "Pixel Tags") in connection with some Newforma Site pages and HTML-formatted email messages for purposes of, among other things, compiling aggregate statistics about website usage and response rates. A Pixel Tag is an electronic image, often a single pixel (1x1), that is ordinarily not visible to website visitors and may be associated with cookies on visitors’ hard drives. Pixel Tags allow us and our service providers to count users who have visited certain pages of the Newforma Site, to deliver customized services, and to help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns. When used in HTML-formatted email messages, Pixel Tags can inform the sender of the email whether and when the email has been opened.

C. As you use the internet, you leave a trail of electronic information at each website you visit. This information, which is sometimes referred to as "clickstream data,” can be collected and stored by a website's server. Clickstream data can reveal the type of computer and browsing software you use and the address of the website from which you linked to the Newforma Site. We may use clickstream data as a form of non-personally identifiable information to determine how much time visitors spend on each page of our Site, how visitors navigate through the Site, and how we may tailor our web pages to better meet the needs of visitors. We will only use this information to improve our Site.

D. Do Not Track. At present, the Site does not specifically respond to browser do-not-track signals.



\9. Collection of Information by Others

Our Terms of Service document identifies certain third-party websites to which we may provide links, and that you may access through our Site.
