# **NEWFORMA - Vendor & Vendor Risk Management** #

# **OVERVIEW**

The purpose of this policy is to provide guidance relative to the management of vendor relationships.  Senior management and the Board of Directors recognize that the development of relationships with vendors is established as a way for Newforma to offer certain products and services without the need to develop the products and services “in house.”  Such “outsourced” relationships benefit Newforma through reduced costs, improved performance, increased business competitiveness, access to a superior knowledge base and the need for a limited in-house staff to support Newforma’s business needs.

Senior Executive management and the Board of Directors also recognize that they are ultimately responsible for managing activities conducted by vendors and identifying and controlling the risks arising from such relationships to the same extent as if they were handled within Newforma.  They recognize that vendor relationships present potential risks that must be properly managed on an ongoing basis, beginning with a sound due diligence process at the outset and continuing with annual or more frequent reviews of all vendor relationships.  It is recognized that the extent of risk varies with each vendor relationship.  Among the most common vendor-related risks are lack of vendor oversight by Newforma which could result in Newforma experiencing operational risks, privacy risks and reputation risks.

The Board of Directors holds senior management accountable for the review and evaluation of all new and existing vendor relationships. Management is responsible for ensuring that adequate controls are in place to protect Newforma and its customers from the risks associated with vendor relationships.

It is the goal of the Information Security Team and the Board of Directors at Newforma to ensure compliance with this policy with respect to every vendor relationship.  However, they recognize that certain existing contracts may not comply with all aspects of this policy.  It is management’s responsibility to continuously seek opportunities to renegotiate changes (e.g., at contract renewal, etc.) to existing vendor contracts to achieve full compliance with this policy.

Management will review this policy at least annually and present it to the Board of Directors for their review and approval.

# **VENDOR RISKS**

There are numerous risks that may arise from Newforma’s use of vendors.  Some of the risks are associated with the underlying activity itself, similar to the risks faced if Newforma conducted the activity.  Other potential risks arise from or are heightened by the involvement of a vendor. Failure to manage these risks can expose Newforma to regulatory action, financial loss, litigation and damage to Newforma’s, and may even impair Newforma’s ability to establish new or service existing customer relationships.

Not all of the following risks will be applicable to every vendor relationship; however, complex or significant arrangements may have definable risks in most areas.  The following summary of risks is not considered all-inclusive.

__Strategic Risk__

Strategic risk is the risk arising from adverse business decisions, or the failure to implement appropriate business decisions in a manner that is consistent with Newforma’s strategic goals.  The use of a vendor to perform functions or to offer products or services that do not help Newforma achieve corporate strategic goals and provide an adequate return on investment exposes Newforma to strategic risk.

__Reputation Risk__

Reputation risk is the risk arising from negative public opinion.  Vendor relationships that result in dissatisfied customers, interactions not consistent with Newforma policies, inappropriate recommendations, security breaches resulting in the disclosure of customer information, and violations of law and regulation are all examples that could harm the reputation and standing of Newforma in the community. Also, any negative publicity involving the vendor, whether or not the publicity is related to Newforma’s use of the vendor, could result in reputation risk.

__Operational Risk__

Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems or from external events.  Vendor relationships often integrate the internal processes of other organizations with Newforma’s processes and can increase the overall operational complexity.

__Transaction Risk__

Transaction risk is the risk arising from problems with service or product delivery.  A vendor’s failure to perform as expected by customers or Newforma due to reasons such as inadequate capacity, technological failure, human error, or fraud, exposes Newforma to transaction risk.  The lack of an effective business resumption plan and appropriate contingency plans increase transaction risk.  Weak control over technology used in the vendor arrangement may result in threats to security and the integrity of systems and resources.  These issues could result in unauthorized transactions or the inability to transact business as expected.

__Credit Risk__

Credit risk is the risk that a vendor, or any other creditor necessary to the vendor relationship, is unable to meet the terms of the contractual arrangements with Newforma or to otherwise financially perform as agreed.  The basic form of credit risk involves the financial condition of the vendor itself.  Some contracts provide that the vendor ensures some measure of performance related to obligations arising from the relationship, such as loan origination programs. In these circumstances, the financial condition of the vendor is a factor in assessing credit risk.  Credit risk also arises from the use of third parties that market or originate certain types of loans, solicit and refer customers, conduct underwriting analysis, or set up product programs for Newforma. Appropriate monitoring of the activity of the vendor is necessary to ensure that credit risk is understood and remains within board approved limits.

__Compliance Risk__

Compliance risk is the risk arising from violations of laws, rules, or regulations, or from noncompliance with internal policies or procedures or with Newforma’s business standards.  This risk exists when the products or activities of a vendor are not consistent with governing laws, rules, regulations, policies, or ethical standards.  Liability could potentially extend to Newforma when vendors violate laws, rules, regulations or other required practices.  Compliance risk is exacerbated when an institution has inadequate oversight, monitoring, or audit functions.

__Other Risk's___

The types of risk introduced by Newforma’s decision to use a vendor cannot be fully assessed without a complete understanding of the resulting arrangement.  Therefore, a comprehensive list of potential risks that could be associated with a vendor relationship is not possible. In addition to the risks described above, vendor relationships may also subject Newforma to liquidity, interest rate, price, foreign currency translation, and country risks.

# **RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS**

The key to the effective use of a vendor in any capacity is for Newforma’s management to appropriately assess, measure, monitor, and control the risks associated with the relationship. While engaging another entity may assist management and the Board in achieving strategic goals, such an arrangement reduces management’s direct control.  Therefore, the use of a vendor increases the need for oversight of the process from start to finish.  There are four main elements of an effective vendor risk management process: (1) risk assessment, (2) due diligence in selecting a vendor, (3) contract structuring and review, and (4) oversight.

While these four elements apply to any vendor activities, the precise use of this process is dependent upon the nature of the vendor relationship, the scope and magnitude of the activity, and the risks identified.  This comprehensive risk management process, which includes management of any vendor relationship, enables management to ensure that capital is sufficient to support the Newforma’s underlying risk exposures and that the vendor is operating in a manner consistent with Federal and state laws, rules, and regulations, including those intended to protect consumers.

# **RISK ASSESSMENT**

Risk assessment is fundamental to the initial decision of whether or not to enter into a vendor relationship.  The first step in the risk assessment process is to ensure that the proposed relationship is consistent with Newforma’s strategic planning and overall business strategy.

Next, management must analyze the benefits, costs, legal aspects, and the potential risks associated with the vendor under consideration.  Expanded analysis is warranted if the product or service is a new activity or product for Newforma.  Management must develop a thorough understanding of what the proposed relationship will accomplish for Newforma, and why the use of a vendor is in Newforma’s best interests.  A risk/reward analysis must be performed for significant matters, comparing the proposed third-party relationship to other methods of performing the activity or product offering, including the use of other vendors or performing the function in-house.  For such matters, the analysis must be considered integral to Newforma’s overall strategic planning and should thus be performed by senior management and reviewed by the Board or an appropriate committee.

Responsible Newforma personnel must have the requisite knowledge and skills to adequately perform the analysis.  Certain aspects of the risk assessment phase may include the use of internal auditors, compliance officers, technology officers, and legal counsel.  This phase must also identify performance criteria, internal controls, reporting needs, and contractual requirements that would be critical to the ongoing assessment and control of specific identified risks.

After completing the general assessment of risks, particularly relative to Newforma’s overall strategic plan, management should review its ability to provide adequate oversight and management of the proposed vendor relationship on an ongoing basis.  While identifying and understanding the risks associated with the vendor are critical at the outset, the long-term management of the relationship is vital to success.  For significant third-party relationships, the Board may consider appointing a senior manager to be responsible for the relationship, including due diligence, implementation, ongoing oversight, and periodic reporting to the Board.  This management official should have the requisite knowledge and skills to critically review all aspects of the relationship.  The Board and management should also ensure that Newforma’s compliance management system is adapted to effectively address the vendor relationship and appropriately respond to emerging issues and compliance deficiencies.

A final part of the initial risk assessment phase for significant relationships involves carefully estimating the long-term financial effect of the proposed vendor relationship.  The Board should take into account all aspects of the long-term potential of the relationship, as well as the managerial expertise and other associated costs that would result from the decision to use a vendor, and not be unduly influenced by short-term cost savings.  The long-term financial risk resulting from an initial incomplete accounting of costs and/or an overestimation of benefits can undermine appropriate decisions in other phases of the risk management process.

# **DUE DILIGENCE IN SELECTING A NEW VENDOR**

Following an assessment of risks and a decision to proceed with a plan to establish a vendor relationship, management must select a qualified entity to implement the activity or program.  The due diligence process provides management with the information needed to address qualitative and quantitative aspects of potential vendors to determine if a relationship would help achieve Newforma’s strategic and financial goals and mitigate identified risks.

Not only should due diligence be performed prior to selecting a third party, but it should also be performed periodically during the course of the relationship, particularly when considering a renewal of a contract.  The scope and depth of due diligence is directly related to the importance and magnitude of Newforma’s relationship with the vendor.

Comprehensive due diligence involves a review of all available information about a potential vendor, focusing on the entity’s financial condition, its specific relevant experience, its knowledge of applicable laws and regulations, its reputation, and the scope and effectiveness of its operations and controls. The evaluation of a third party may include the following items:

__Technical and Industry Expertise__

Assessment the vendor’s experience and ability to provide the necessary services for current and anticipated needs.
* Identification of areas where Newforma would have to supplement the vendor’s expertise to fully manage risk.
* Evaluation of the vendor’s use of third parties that would be used to support the vendor’s operations.
* Evaluation of the vendor’s experience in providing services in the anticipated operating environment.
* Evaluation of the vendor’s ability to respond to service disruptions.
* Evaluation of references and user group opinions for the purpose of determining the vendor’s reputation and performance history.
* Evaluation of the vendor’s knowledge of the regulations that are relevant to the services the vendor is providing.
* Evaluation of key vendor personnel that would be assigned to support Newforma.

## __Operations and Controls__

* Determination of the adequacy of a vendor’s standards, policies and procedures relating to internal controls, facilities management (access requirements, sharing of facilities, etc.), security (systems, data, equipment, etc.), privacy protections, maintenance of records, business resumption contingency planning, systems development and maintenance and employee background checks.

* When applicable, the determination of the adequacy of the vendor’s security precautions with respect to Newforma’s resources and the detection and response to intrusions.

* Evaluation of Newforma’s ability to have complete and timely access to the information maintained by the vendor.

* Performance of on-site visits, when necessary, to better understand how the vendor operates and supports its clients.

__Financial condition__

* Analysis of the vendor’s most recent audited financial statements and annual report as well as other available documents (SEC filings, etc.).

* Consideration of factors such as how long the vendor has been in business and the vendor’s market share for a given service and how much it has fluctuated.

* Consideration of the significance of Newforma’s proposed contract on the vendor’s financial condition.

* Evaluation of resource expenditures to ensure that the vendor’s level of investment in its resources is consistent with supporting Newforma’s activities. The vendor should have the financial resources to invest in and support the required level of service.

* Existence of any significant complaints or litigation, or regulatory actions against the vendor.

__Contract issues__
A contract review provides an effective way to identify risk with a current or prospective vendor.  Contracts with vendors should adhere to the same general guidelines as other contractual relationships in which Newforma is involved.  The contract should include clear and concise language regarding the arrangement between Newforma and the vendor.

When entering into a contract it is management’s responsibility to ensure that the following issues are addressed within the vendor contract.  However, management and the Board of Directors recognize that not all vendors will agree to the terms desired by Newforma and that under limited circumstances Newforma may not be able to address each item noted below.  To the extent that all items are not adequately addressed, it is the responsibility of the owner of the vendor relationship to inform the Vendor Management Committee, prior to execution of a contract, of any items omitted from the recommended contractual items listed below.

* **Scope of Service:**  Contracts should clearly describe the rights and responsibilities of parties involved.  Considerations should include:

 * Timeframes and activities for implementation and assignment of responsibilities. Services to be performed by the vendor, including support, maintenance, training and customer service.
 * Obligations of Newforma in the relationship.
 * The contracting parties’ rights in modifying the existing services performed under the contract.
 * Guidelines for adding new or different services and for contract renegotiation.

* **Performance Standards:**  Minimum service level requirements and remedies for failure to meet standards should be included in the contract.

* **Security and Confidentiality:**  The contract should address the vendor’s responsibility for security and confidentiality of Newforma’s resources. The agreement should prohibit the vendor and its agents from using or disclosing Newforma’s information, except as necessary to or consistent with providing the contracted services, to protect against unauthorized use. If the vendor receives nonpublic financial information regarding Newforma customers, Newforma must notify the vendor to fully disclose breaches in security resulting in unauthorized intrusions into the vendor that may materially affect Newforma or its customers. The vendor should report any material intrusions, the effect on Newforma and the corrective action taken to respond to the intrusion.  The owner of the vendor relationship should refer to Newforma’s Information Security Program for further guidance.

* **Internal Controls:** Consideration should be given to contract provisions addressing control over operations such as:

 * Internal controls to be maintained by the vendor.
 * Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.
 * Records to be maintained by vendors.
 * Access to the records by Newforma.
 * Notification by the vendor to Newforma and Newforma’s approval rights regarding material changes to services, systems, controls, key project personnel allocated to Newforma, and new service locations.
 * Setting and monitoring of parameters relating to any financial functions, such as payments processing and any extensions of credit on behalf of Newforma.
 * Insurance coverage to be maintained by the vendor.

* **Audit:** The contract should include the types of audit reports Newforma is entitled to receive. The contract should specify audit frequency, cost to Newforma associated with the audits if any, as well as the rights of Newforma and its agencies to obtain the results of the audits in a timely manner. The contract should also specify rights to obtain documentation regarding the resolution of audit disclosed deficiencies and inspect the vendor’s facilities and operating practices of the vendor. Management should consider, based on the risk assessment phase, the degree to which independent internal audits completed by the vendor audit staff can be used and the need for external audits and reviews.

* **Reports:** Contractual terms should discuss the frequency and type of reports Newforma will receive. Guidelines and fees for obtaining custom reports should also be discussed.

* **Business Continuity Planning/Disaster Recovery Planning:** The contract should address the vendor’s responsibility for backup and record protection, including equipment, program and data files, and the maintenance of disaster recovery and contingency plans. The plans must be tested periodically (at least annually) with results provided to Newforma. Interdependencies between vendors must be considered when determining business resumption testing requirements. The vendor should provide Newforma with operating procedures for the vendor and Newforma in the event business resumption contingency plans are implemented. Contracts should include specific provisions for business recovery timeframes that meet Newforma’s business requirements. The contract must not contain any provisions that would excuse the vendor from implementing its contingency plans.

* **Sub-Contracting and Multiple Vendor Relationships:**  Contracts with vendors should include a provision specifying that the contracting vendor is responsible for the service provided to Newforma regardless of which entity is actually conducting the operations and that Newforma must approve any changes regarding the status of sub-contractor relationships.

* **Use of Newforma Resources:**  All contracts with vendors must address ownership and allowable use by the vendor of Newforma’s data, equipment/hardware, system documentation and other intellectual property rights including logo, trademarks, etc. The contract should not contain unnecessary limitations on the return of items owned by Newforma.

* **Duration:**  The type of service being provided should be considered when negotiating the appropriate length of a vendor contract and its renewal periods. The length of time required for notification of intent not to renew a contract with a vendor should be specified and should be reasonable.

* **Dispute Resolution:**  Where possible and practical, vendor contracts should contain a provision for the resolution of disputes in a timely manner. The contract should also provide for the continuation of services during the dispute resolution period.

* **Indemnification:**  Indemnification provisions should be reviewed to reduce the likelihood of potential situations in which Newforma may be liable for claims arising as a result of the negligence of the vendor.  While Newforma seeks to mitigate risk through the use of indemnification, this practice alone does not insulate Newforma from its ultimate responsibility to conduct related activities in a safe and sound manner and in compliance with law.

* **Limitation of Liability:**  Some vendor standard contracts may contain clauses limiting the amount of liability that can be incurred by the vendor. Such contracts should be examined to ensure that the damage limitation bears an adequate relationship to the amount of loss Newforma might reasonably experience as a result of the vendor’s failure to perform its obligations.

* **Termination:**  The extent and flexibility of termination rights sought can vary depending on the vendor. Termination rights may be sought for a variety of conditions. All contracts with vendors should permit Newforma to terminate the contract in a timely manner and without prohibitive expense. Each contract should state termination and notification requirements with time frames to allow the orderly conversion to another vendor. Contracts must provide for timely return of any data and other intellectual and physical property owned by Newforma. Any costs associated with transition assistance should be clearly stated.

* **Assignment:**  Any contract with a vendor should contain a provision that prohibits the assignment of the contract to a vendor without the consent of Newforma. This includes changes to any subcontractors.

# **OVERSIGHT**

Newforma must maintain adequate oversight of vendor activities and adequate quality control over those products and services provided through vendor arrangements in order to minimize exposure to potential significant financial loss, reputation damage, and supervisory action.  The Board should initially approve, oversee, and review at least annually significant vendor arrangements, and review these arrangements and written agreements whenever there is a material change to the program.  Management must periodically review the vendor’s operations in order to verify that they are consistent with the terms of the written agreement and that risks are being controlled.  Newforma’s compliance management system should ensure continuing compliance with applicable federal and state laws, rules, and regulations, as well as internal policies and procedures.

Management must allocate sufficient qualified staff to monitor significant vendor relationships and provide the necessary oversight.  Management must consider designating a specific officer to coordinate the oversight activities with respect to significant relationships, and involve their compliance management function and, as necessary, involve other operational areas such as audit and information technology, in the monitoring process.  The extent of oversight of a particular third-party relationship will depend upon the potential risks and the scope and magnitude of the arrangement.

An oversight program will generally include monitoring of the vendor’s quality of service, risk management practices, financial condition, and applicable controls and reports.  Results of oversight activities for material vendor arrangements must be periodically reported to Newforma’s Board of Directors or designated committee.  Identified weaknesses should be documented and promptly addressed.

Performance monitoring should include, as appropriate, the following:

* Evaluate the overall effectiveness of the vendor relationship and the consistency of the relationship with Newforma’s strategic goals.
* Review any licensing or registrations to ensure the vendor can legally perform its services.
* Evaluate the vendor’s financial condition at least annually. Financial review should be as comprehensive as the credit risk analysis performed on Newforma’s borrowing relationships.  Audited financial statements should be required for significant third-party relationships.
* Review the adequacy of the vendor’s insurance coverage.
* Ensure that the vendor’s financial obligations to others are being met.
* Review audit reports or other reports of the vendor and follow up on any needed corrective actions.
* Review the adequacy and adherence to the vendor’s policies relating to internal controls and security issues.
* Monitor for compliance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations.
* Review the vendor’s business resumption contingency planning and testing.
* Assess the effect of any changes in key vendor personnel involved in the relationship with Newforma.
* Review reports relating to the vendor’s performance in the context of contractual requirements and performance standards, with appropriate follow-up as needed.
* Determine the adequacy of any training provided to employees of Newforma and the vendor.
* Administer any testing programs for vendors with direct interaction with customers.
* Review customer complaints about the products and services provided by the vendor and the resolution of the complaints.
* Meet as needed with representatives of the vendor to discuss performance and operational issues.

Proper documentation will facilitate the monitoring and management of the risks associated with vendor relationships. Therefore, Newforma must maintain documents and records on all aspects of the vendor relationship, including valid contracts, business plans, risk analyses, due diligence, and oversight activities (including reports to the Board or delegated committees).

# 

# 

# **DOCUMENTING NEW VENDOR SELECTION**

For a new vendor, the following documentation, at a minimum, must be completed and submitted prior to any contract being signed:

* **Vendor Risk Assessment/Risk Rating Form** (see Appendix “A”) which includes the following requirements:

 * Financial Analysis (two years financial statements/tax returns)
 * Proof of Business (Articles of Incorporation/Association)
 * Professional References (Three business references)
 * Operational Analysis including SAS 70 and Newforma’s response to the SAS70 User Concerns (if applicable)
 * Disaster Contingency Plans and/or testing results of DR plans (if applicable)
 * Contract Review for compliance with GLBA
 * Review of proposed Service Level Agreement
 * Evaluate the existing risks that exist with this vendor in the areas listed below and indicate whether these risks are increasing/decreasing or stable:

   * Strategic Risk
   * Reputation Risk
   * Compliance Risk
   * Transaction Risk
   * Credit Risk
   * Privacy / Info Security Risk
   * Other Risks

* **Vendor CIP Form** (see Appendix “B”)

The completed Vendor Risk Assessment/Rating and Vendor CIP Forms are to be submitted and approved by the IT Steering Committee.  Any exception to these requirements must be approved by the Chief Operating Officer or Chief Financial Officer.

# **DUE DILIGENCE OF EXISTING VENDOR**

On at least an annual basis, vendors must be re-assessed.  The Vendor Assessment/Risk Rating Form must be completed.  Please refer to Appendix “A.””  Included in the risk assessment, the relationship owner is asked to consider the following areas in managing the existing vendor:

1. Evaluate the existing risks that exist with this vendor in the areas listed below and indicate whether these risks are increasing/decreasing or stable:

 * Strategic Risk
 * Reputation Risk
 * Compliance Risk
 * Transaction Risk
 * Credit Risk
 * Privacy / Info Security Risk
 * Other Risk

   * Liquidity
   * Interest Rate
   * Price
   * Foreign Currency Translation
   * Country

* Evaluate the vendor’s financial condition periodically.

* Review audit reports (e.g., SAS 70, etc.) as well as regulatory examination reports if available, and evaluate the adequacy of the vendor’s systems and controls including resource availability, security, integrity and confidentiality. Follow up on any deficiencies noted in the audits and reviews of the vendor and respond to all issues addressed as “User Concerns.”

* Perform on-site inspections in conjunction with some of the reviews performed above, where practicable and necessary.

* Review the vendor’s business resumption contingency plans to ensure that any services considered mission critical for Newforma could be restored within an acceptable timeframe. Review the vendor’s program for contingency plan testing. For mission critical services, the contingency plan must be tested at least annually.

* Periodically review the vendor’s performance relative to service level agreements, determine whether other contractual terms and conditions are being met, and whether any revisions to service level expectations or other terms are needed given changes in Newforma’s needs and technological developments.

* At meetings with vendor, ensure there are proper controls in place for protection of customer documents and information. Ensure the vendors understanding of their responsibility to report intrusion or information leaks to Newforma on a timely basis.

* Maintain documents and records regarding contract compliance, revision and dispute resolution.

# **DOCUMENTING EXISTING VENDOR ANNUAL REVIEW**

The Vendor Management Program for existing vendors is comprised of four key steps:

1. Identify and classify Newforma’s vendors into tiers based on potential risk associated with the vendor:

* **Tier 1:** Major Vendors whose process is core to Newforma’s daily operations (i.e., core data or item processing).  These vendors can be potential operational risks for Newforma and Newforma’s customers if they did not operate as expected.  Tier 1 vendors include:

 * Vendor and vendor activity has a material effect on Newforma’s revenues or expenses.
 * Vendors performs some form of “critical function;”
 * The vendor stores, accesses, transmits or performs transactions on sensitive customer information.
 * Vendor markets Newforma products or services.
 * Vendor provides a product or performs a service involving subprime lending or card payment processing; or
 * Vendor poses risks that could significantly affect earnings or capital.

* **Tier 2:** Vendors that maintain direct relationships with Newforma customers through a referral by Newforma.  Although these customers would not present an operational risk to Newforma if they did not continue since their relationship is directly with the customer, Newforma may still subject itself to reputation risk if the vendor ceased operation.

2. On an annual basis, Newforma will gather and systematically file all relative due diligence documentation for each vendor based on the tier to which they have been assigned.  Although there is a coordinator of the Vendor Management program, the “owner” of the vendor relationship is responsible for gathering and reviewing the data required:

 * **Tier 1:** Major Vendors require the following documentation:

1. Vendor Risk Assessment/Risk Rating Form (see Risk Assessment below)
2. Financial Analysis
3. Operational Analysis including SAS 70 and Newforma’s response to the SAS70 User Concerns
4. Disaster Contingency Plans and/or testing results of DR plans
5. Contract Review for compliance with GLBA
6. Review of Service Level Agreements
7. Other information deemed appropriate based on the vendor and the associated level of risk.

 * **Tier 2:** Vendor Vendors require the following documentation:

     1. Vendor Risk Assessment/Risk Rating Form
     2. Contract Review for compliance with GLBA
     3. Other information deemed appropriate based on the vendor and the associated level of risk.

1. The Vendor Management Committee is to review all due diligence documentation provided by the owners of the vendors.  The vendor management program coordinator will ensure that all documents are completed by the owners and submitted to the IT Steering Committee.  The IT Steering Committee will insure that Newforma does not continue with any vendors that are considered undue risk or risk that is beyond Newforma’s tolerance.  Alternate plans will be considered if the vendor has breached contractual terms.

2. After review by the Vendor Management Committee, the Board of Directors or an assigned Board committee will review management’s summary findings.  The Risk Assessments for the Tier 1 and Tier 2 vendors will all be submitted to the Board (or assigned committee) for review.
