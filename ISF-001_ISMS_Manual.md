0 Introduction
Newforma Inc. (“Newforma” or the “Company”) is committed to ensuring the continuity of its
business in the face of security breaches and unwanted events and has crafted an Information
Security Management System (“ISMS”) that is compliant with ISO/IEC 27002:2013, the
International standard for information security. (ISO 27002:2013 will be referred to as “ISO
27002” for the remainder of this document).
```
```
The purpose of this document is to describe the way the business operates, both the internal
and external factors influencing it, and to highlight in general terms the potential consequences
of a security breach. This will allow the appropriate level of measures to be put in place to
reduce the level of risk and to ensure that plans are available and tested to manage the impact
of any Interruptions that do occur.
```
```
Newforma is committed to protecting the confidentiality, integrity and availability of important
information, monitoring risks, and ensuring that facilities operated by the organization are
continuously available for business operation. The organization’s business involves access to
large amounts of information; the loss, breach or unavailability of this information would have
serious repercussions to the organization and loss of customer confidence.
```
```
Newforma aims to be recognized as an organization adhering to the highest level of Information
Security best practices. Compliance to the ISO 27002 standard serves to fulfil this objective.
```
### 0.1 General Requirements

```
As part of the Management Review process (See Section 9.8), the ISMS will be reviewed
and, when required, changes shall be made to the ISMS in order to ensure that it continues
to meet the intended requirements.
```
```
This Information Security Management System Manual (the “ISMS Manual”) is written to
document the processes, roles and responsibilities within Newforma that have been
implemented to manage the information security process.
```
```
The use of an ISMS is an internationally recognized best practice to manage security risks
and to manage the information security controls that are used to mitigate such risks.
```

© 2017 Newforma Inc.- Company Internal Page 6 PRIVACY AND SECURITY POLICY

```
Newforma’s commitment to following an ISMS that is compliant with the ISO27002 standard
provides an assurance to Top Management, and all Interested parties, that Newforma’s
ISMS conforms to a recognized international standard for information security.
```
```
A key component of the ISO27002 standard is that an ISMS and ISMS Manual is in place
and that the organizational approach for managing information security is defined.
Newforma has issued a set of Information Security policies which provide the required basis
and describes how information security is managed in the organization.
```
```
This ISMS, based upon the Plan Do Check Act model ensures that the security of the
organization’s information complies with the requirements of ISO27002.
```
```
1 Scope
Newforma’s top management maintains a commitment to information security compliance with
the ISO/IEC 27002 information security standard, for a number of reasons, including but not
limited to:
```
```
 Newforma has an obligation to internal and external interested parties, to protect the
confidentiality, integrity and availability of information risks.
 Compliance supports a strong commitment to information security & promotes Newforma
as a leader in its field.
 To ensure business continuity and reliability by preventing and minimizing the impact of
security incidents.
 To facilitate business improvement through the adoption of secure business practice and
business management.
This document defines the scope of Newforma’s ISMS. It clearly identifies those parts of the
Company for which compliance is applicable and also which elements are specifically outside
the scope, if any. The scope of the ISMS is the basis upon which auditors plan and size the
extent of the assessment, and against which they ultimately carry out their audit. Newforma’s
Compliance Committee consists of members of top management, who oversee, review, develop
```
## and improve the overall ISMS within the Company.

## 6 Planning

### 6.1 Actions to address risks and opportunities:................................................................................


© 2017 Newforma Inc.- Company Internal Page
PRIVACY AND SECURITY POLICY

```
Potential impact of an information security incident:
```
```
The impact of any specific incident shall depend upon its nature and a comprehensive
risk assessment that is performed to assess and treat those risks that can be reasonably
identified. In general terms the potential impact of any risk inhibiting the performance of
normal business processes shall be shown in one or more key areas, including but not
limited to:
```
```
 Loss of sales revenue
 Impacted to reputation / customer confidence
 Inability to meet our legal obligations
```
##  Breach of contractual obligations

##  Loss of business opportunity

### 6.2 Risk Factors:

```
When planning for the ISMS, the organization shall consider the issues and
requirements referred to in this document (e.g., Sections 4.1 and 4.2) when determining
the risks and opportunities that should be addressed in order to:
```
```
 Ensure the information security management system can achieve its intended
outcome(s).
 Prevent, or reduce, undesired effects.
 Achieve continual improvement.
```
### 6.3 Risk Appetite:

```
The ISMS is designed to address the major risks that are identified to the information
security of Newforma. In identifying, assessing and managing these risks there are a
number of options open to the organization according to its appetite for risk.
```
```
In general terms Newforma’s appetite for risk is Low.
```
```
Low: The strategy of the organization is to avoid risk where possible, to the extent
appropriate, and to invest resources into mitigating residual risk through effective
information security measures, as necessary.
```
```
This level of risk appetite shall apply to the risk assessments that are carried out as part
of the ISMS and shall determine the actions that need to be taken to mitigate risk to an
acceptable level.
```

© 2017 Newforma Inc.- Company Internal Page
PRIVACY AND SECURITY POLICY

### 6.4 Internal Uncertainty Factors:

```
With regard to the Newforma’s business itself, there are a number of internal factors that
create uncertainty which give rise to risk. These may include but are not limited to:
```
```
 Staff turnover
 Staff performance
 Significant organizational changes
 Location moves
 Company financial performance
 Breach of Data via Internal mechanisms
```
```
These general internal uncertainty factors may be considered in more detail as part of
the risk assessment process.
```
### 6.5 External Uncertainty Factors:

```
With regard to the external environment in which Newforma operates, there are a
number of external factors that may create uncertainty, which gives rise to risk, such as:
```
```
 Uncertainties in Supplier contractual obligations
 Potential legislative or regulatory changes
 Political unrest in the locations in which the organization operates
 Inherent environmental risks e.g. forest fire, floods, bomb threats etc. (see BCP Plan)
 Economic factors e.g. supplier failure, lack of customer demand
 Effects of Cyber Security holes, hacking, destructive malware
```
```
These general external uncertainty factors may be considered in more detail as part of
the risk assessment process.
```
### 6.6 Security Risk Management:

```
The criteria for assessing risk in the context of the organization’s appetite for risk are
defined in this section. Newforma utilizes the Probability (Likelihood) – Impact Matrix to
determine a risk rating value and then evaluates the risk against all 114 controls that are
enabled in the Statement of Applicability. Where applicable Newforma will group risks
together based on similar outcomes to manage risk in a more uniform fashion.
```
```
Newforma conducts ongoing assessments of threats and risks to determine the
necessity of safeguards. Newforma continuously monitors for any change in the threat
environment and makes any adjustments necessary to maintain an acceptable level of
risk, which is considered a balance between operational needs, cost, speed, and
security. The Information Security risk management process includes, but it not limited
to:
```
```
 Identifying the level of compliance to industry best practice for Information Security.
```

© 2017 Newforma Inc.- Company Internal Page
PRIVACY AND SECURITY POLICY

```
 Assessing exposure to a list of common risk impacts and likelihood’s.
 Identifying key information risk areas and subjecting them to IT specific risk
assessments.
 Maintaining risk registers, which include information security and operational risks.
 Assessing the risk based on the adequacy of existing safeguards.
 Implementing technical and administrative controls and initiatives to reduce or
eliminate identified risks.
 Regular reviews of the performance and effectiveness of implemented controls.
```
##  Reporting significant risks to the Compliance Committee.

```
Newforma’s risk management process provides the context for identification, evaluation and
control of information related risks through the establishment and maintenance of an ISMS. The
Risk Assessment, Statement of Applicability, and Risk Treatment Plan describe how these risks
are controlled.
```
## Business Impact Assessment

```
Newforma rates the initial risk assessment based on the likelihood of the risk occurring on a
```
## scale of 1-5 and the impact to the business on a scale of 1-5, to achieve a risk score. The

```
Information Risk Owner is required to identify the consequences to the business of a worst case
breach of confidentiality, integrity or availability according to the following rating.
```
## The formula for figuring out the risk score is as follows:

## Likelihood Matrix:


© 2017 Newforma Inc.- Company Internal Page
PRIVACY AND SECURITY POLICY

## Impact to the Business Matrix:

## When determining the impact to the business the following table of examples can be

## compared to:

## Impact Examples Chart:


© 2017 Newforma Inc.- Company Internal Page
PRIVACY AND SECURITY POLICY

```
Once the Risk Score has been achieved, plot the risk score on the risk matrix to find the level of
risk required for each scenario:
```
```
Depending on the outcome of the risk assessment score, plotted onto the matrix, the score will
determine the level of risk treatment each item qualifies for. Items that obtain a risk score of 16-
25 shall be assessed against all 114 controls based on Newforma’s ISF-003 Statement of
Applicability taken from the controls listed in the ISO27002:2013 standard and placed on a risk
treatment plan until mitigated and deemed acceptable and approved by Newforma’s
Compliance Committee or top management.
```
## Risk Treatment:

```
Risk Treatment actions are prioritized based upon the Risk Matrix Rating for the associated
asset. Newforma has established four (4) risk treatment options for managing risk.
```
1. Accept
2. Reduce
3. Avoid
4. Transfer


© 2017 Newforma Inc.- Company Internal Page
PRIVACY AND SECURITY POLICY

1. Accept:

```
Newforma shall accept all risk measures calculated as LOW or VERY LOW.
```
```
The Compliance Committee or top management can, for any of the following reasons, accept
the risk if the risk measure is MEDIUM:
```
```
 If the control or process will not align with the culture of Newforma.
 If the necessary personnel are not available to mitigate the risk.
 If the financial resource is not available.
 If there is no benefit to Newforma.
 If the cost of implementing the control exceeds the perceived or actual cost of a
security breach.
```
```
Risks designated as VERY HIGH or HIGH can be accepted by the Compliance Committee or top
management if a formal Risk Acceptance is documented, detailing the risk as it relates to the
business risk appetite, the justification for the risk acceptance, and the proposed timescale for the
acceptance.
```
```
Risk Acceptances should be documented and approved by the Compliance Committee or top
management and processed through the ticketing system with recorded approvals.
```
2. Reduce

```
If the risk has been calculated as VERY HIGH, HIGH or Medium then the ISO/IEC 27002
applicable controls in the Newforma Statement of Applicability shall be referred to and
procedures, process’s, practices or mechanisms that mitigate the risk to an acceptable level and
match Newforma requirements, will be selected. Any additional controls that will have a positive
effect on the business or existing processes (and are cost effective) will also be implemented.
```
```
A risk measure of VERY HIGH or HIGH is defined as unacceptable to Newforma unless
authorised by the Compliance Committee or top management.
```
```
A risk measure of VERY HIGH is defined as unacceptable to Newforma and shall be treated as
a priority.
```
3. Avoid
Newforma also has the capability to avoid risk. Either stopping a process or eliminating a threat
or vulnerability will achieve this. Whenever risks have been avoided, the actions taken shall be
appropriately documented (e.g., Newforma Compliance Committee minutes) and reviewed with
the Newforma Information Security Team.
4. Transfer
Where appropriate, Newforma shall transfer risks to other organizations. The Corporate Security
Team is responsible for ensuring that the responsibilities that have been discharged are
appropriate to the risk and that partners are fully aware of their responsibilities. Whenever risks


© 2017 Newforma Inc.- Company Internal Page
PRIVACY AND SECURITY POLICY

```
have been transferred, the actions taken shall be appropriately documented (e.g., the
Compliance Committee’s minutes and/or relevant contracts, to the extent appropriate and
```
## necessary).

```
NOTE 1. Annex A contains a comprehensive list of control objectives and controls. Users of this
ISO/IEC: 27002 International Standard are directed to ISO/IEC: 27001:2013 Annex A to obtain
the controls and ensure that no necessary controls are overlooked.
```
```
NOTE 2. Control objectives are implicitly included in the controls chosen. The control objectives
and controls listed in Annex A are not exhaustive and additional control objectives and controls
may be needed.
```
## Statement of Applicability:

```
The Corporate Security Team shall compile a Statement of Applicability that lists all controls that
have been selected and identifies whether the control is fully or partially implemented in relation
to the requirements of the control objectives.
```
```
Reasons for selecting controls are documented as part of the gap analysis / risk assessment
process. The justifications for controls that have not been selected are documented with the
Statement of Applicability. Where it is not possible to implement a control or the risk cannot be
mitigated the justifications are authorized and approved by the Compliance Committee.
```

## 8 Operation:

### 8.1 Operational planning and control:


© 2017 Newforma Inc.- Company Internal Page
PRIVACY AND SECURITY POLICY

```
The controls selected from Newforma’s “Statement of Applicability” to treat the risks, are
wherever possible, linked to the identified or perceived threats and vulnerabilities
identified during the risk assessment process. If a number of controls have been
selected to treat a risk, Newforma may support the risk treatment plan with project plans,
or additional implementation documentation.
```
```
The risk process allows Newforma to identify any controls (documented or informal) that
are currently being used, and to identify where additional controls are required to reduce
the risk to an acceptable level. Newforma may also implement additional controls that
are not directly attributable to an identified risk but make commercial or economic sense.
```
```
All selected controls are documented in the Statement of Applicability. The
implementation of new controls is documented in a risk treatment plan.
```
```
Where it is not possible to implement a control or the risk cannot be mitigated the
justifications are authorized by the Compliance Committee or top management as
appropriate, who reviews and approves the proposed residual risk.
```
### 8.2 Information security risk assessment:

```
The ongoing management of risks is controlled by inputting data from incident reports,
audit results, technical advisories and confirmed or potential technical or process
vulnerabilities into subsequent risk assessments. New critical information risks, facilities
and buildings are subjected to risk assessment as part of the project process.
```
```
The Corporate Security Team is responsible for ensuring that changes to Newforma, its
technology, business objectives, processes, legal requirements and identified threats are
incorporated into the ISMS. Where appropriate, the Corporate Security Team will initiate
a risk assessment process to ensure that security controls are relevant.
```
```
Newforma may, if required, reactively implement additional controls without undertaking
a full risk assessment, if the threat or vulnerability could have a significant impact on
Newforma.
```
```
All changes to the ISMS shall be reviewed by the Compliance Committee and
documented within the meeting minutes.
```
### 8.3 Information security risk treatment:

```
The Corporate Security Team is responsible for establishing and maintaining a risk
treatment plan in order to achieve the identified control objectives. The risk treatment
plan identifies priorities based upon the perceived risk, and considers funding,
responsibilities, actions and estimated date of completion.
```

© 2017 Newforma Inc.- Company Internal Page
PRIVACY AND SECURITY POLICY

```
The Corporate Security Team is responsible for tracking and chasing the progress of risk
treatments, and updating the Risk Treatment Plan with progress and updated actions.
```
```
The Compliance Committee shall review the Risk Treatment Plan and ensure that
actions are being implemented and closed in a timely manner. If necessary, the
Compliance Committee shall escalate unresolved or slow actions to the appropriate
management functions to ensure actions are dealt with.
```
