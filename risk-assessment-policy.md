Purpose
This policy defines the risk management requirements for the identification of the appropriate control posture for all computer and communications information system assets at the company.
Scope
This policy applies to all, employees, facilities, computer systems and facilities at the company, with a target audience of Newforma worldwide.
Policy
Enterprise Risk Management Process
Enterprise Security Risk Assessment
Each year (November) the information security department in addition with the information technology and Human Resources departments must conduct, or manage an independent party who conducts an organization wide security risk assessment. The report resulting from this project must include a detailed description of the information security risks currently facing the organization, and specific recommendations for preventing or mitigating these risks.
Business Unit Risk Assessment
Each critical organizational or business unit within the company that manages its own computers or networks must also perform, at least annually, a security-related risk analysis of these same systems, coordinated through the information security department and then certify that adequate security measures have been implemented to mitigate the risks.
Annual Information Technology Risk Report
For the board of directors to properly perform its risk management role, IT management must submit to the board a special annual report. This report is to include a description of all material company information technology-related risks, as well as an assessment of how these risks are currently being managed.
Risk Assessment Methodology
The company requires where appropriate that a risk assessment process be used where specified by policies, laws, or regulations. The company assessments are to be conducted using the facilitated risk assessment process (See Risk Management Guide for Information Technology Systems NIST SP 800-30)
Material or Significant Information Security Risks
For every material or significant information systems security risk identified, whether through formal risk assessment or not, management must make a specific decision about the degree to which the company will be self-insured and accept the risk, seek external insurance, or adjust controls to reduce expected losses to an acceptable cost of conducting business.
Annual Evaluation of Information Security Operations Outsourcing
As part of the annual risk management process dealing with information security issues at the company, the Chief Information Officer must review what information security operational tasks are, and what tasks are not outsourced. The CIO must then determine based on input from the information security managers which of these tasks will be outsourced in the future
Information Systems Risk Management
Information Security Impact Analysis
Whenever sensitive information is to be placed in computers or whenever sensitive information is to be used in new or substantially different ways on computer systems, a risk assessment of the potential security-related impacts must be performed.
Production System Risk Assessment
Information systems security risk assessments for critical information systems and critical production applications must be performed at least once every two years. All major enhancements, upgrades, conversions, and related changes associated with these systems or applications must be preceded by a risk assessment. Specific instances requiring risk assessments include:
1.	All systems being implemented or constructed will be assessed for risk by a project oriented team during the preliminary design phase, before funding has been finalized.
2.	All production computer information systems must be reevaluated for risk when they are to be significantly modified or enhanced.
3.	All production information systems that are being considered for development or deployed by external parties.
Third Party Disclosures
Information Sensitivity Screening and Disclosure to Third Parties
Prior to providing any non-public company information to an outsourcing firm, business partner, or any other non-governmental entity, the relevant information owner, information security manager, and chief legal counsel must jointly perform a risk assessment. This team, or their delates must then collectively agree that the risks associated with this disclosure do not present an undue threat to the company business interests.
Vulnerability and Threat Analysis
Production Operating System Change Reviews
Periodic reviews or vulnerability assessments of production computer operating systems must be conducted.
Scanning Network Exposed Systems Components
Every major system component (hardware and software) accessible from an external network for which a vulnerability identification package exists must be scanned at least monthly to prevent vulnerabilities from being exploited by intruders.
Vulnerability Advisories
On a weekly or more frequent basis, systems administration staff must review all information security vulnerability advisories issued by trusted organizations for items affecting the company systems.
Vulnerability Identification Software
To ensure that the company technical staff has taken appropriate preventative measures, all systems directly-connected to the internet must be subjected to an automated risk analysis performed via vulnerability identification software at least once a month.
Security Fixes
All security problem fix software and command scripts provided by operating system vendors and trusted third parties must be promptly installed.
On-going Third Party Security Configuration Scanning
All company computers accessible from the internet as well as all internal production computers must be regularly scanned by a reputable third party security vulnerability identification services.
Insurance
Insurance Coverage
Adequate insurance coverage must be obtained and kept in force for every major threat facing the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information handled by the company computer and communication systems.
Significant Information Security Risks
For every significant information systems security risk, management must make a specific decision about the degree to which the company will be self insured and accept the risk, seek external insurance, or adjust controls to reduce expected losses.
BCP and Insurance
The company will maintain insurance commensurate with those residual risks identified from a corporate business impact analysis which pose potential for financial loss or other disastrous consequences as well as the expenses related to recovery from a disaster. The chief financial officer will conduct an annual insurance review to ensure that the level and types of coverage are commercially reasonable and consistent with any legal, management, and board requirements. To facilitate the claims process., the business continuity planning team will create and retain a comprehensive hardware and software inventory list and a comprehensive list of business asset inventory. Copies of both inventories are to be retained in a secure off-site location along with copies of all other continuity planning documentation. A detailed accounting of expenses incurred during recovery or restoration should be documented to support insurance claims.
Violations
Any violation of this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. The company reserves the right to notify the appropriate law enforcement authorities of any unlawful activity and to cooperate in any investigation of such activity. The company does not consider conduct in violation of the policy to be within an employee’s or partner’s course and scope of employment, or the direct consequences of the discharge of the employee’s or partners duties. Accordingly, to the extent permitted by law, the company reserves the right not to defend or pay any damages awarded against employees or partners that result from violations of this policy.
Any employee or partner who is requested to undertake an activity which he or she believes is in violation of this policy must provide a written or verbal complaint to his or her manager, any other manager, or the human resources department as soon as possible.
Roles and Responsibilities
One of the major strengths of the formal risk assessment lies in the way that it composes the team to perform the risk assessment. Drawing together the process owners, stakeholders, and subject matter expects from the spectrum of disciplines involved builds a formidable train trust to conduct the formal risk assessment itself and ultimately builds ownership of the resulting methods and processes to better assure protection of the business assets involved.
Formal Risk Assessment Team
The formal risk assessment team defines the specific scope of the risk assessment then identifies threats, assets, vulnerabilities, and risks to the network processing environment. Additionally, the team identifies risk mediation by controls already in place. Remaining residual risks are categorized as either major or minor, and are included in the analysis of the effectiveness of the security protection on the environment in the scope of the specific formal risk assessment.
Senior Management
Senior management under the standard of due care and ultimate responsibility for mission accomplishment, must ensure that the necessary resources are effectively applied to develop the capabilities needed to accomplish the mission. They must also assess and incorporate results of the risk assessment activity into the decision making process. An effective risk management program that assesses and mitigates IT related mission risks requires the support and involvement of senior management.
Chief Information Officer
The chief information officer is responsible for the enterprises IT planning, budgeting, and performance including its information security components. Decisions made in these areas should be based on an effective risk management program.
System and Information Owners
The system and information owners are responsible for ensuring that proper controls are in place to address integrity, confidentiality, and availability of the IT systems and data they own. This includes changes to the IT systems. They usually have to approve and sign off on changes to these systems. The system and information owners must therefore understand their role in the risk management process.
IT Security Personnel
IT security practitioners (network, system, application, and database admins, computer specialists, security analysis, and security consultants) are responsible for proper implementation of security requirements in their respective IT systems. As changes occur in the existing infrastructure and organizational policies, and introduction of new technologies the IT security practitioners must support or use the risk management process to identity and assess new potential risks and implement new security controls as needed to safeguard their IT systems.
