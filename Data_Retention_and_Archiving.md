## 1.0 Policy Statement

```
In the course of carrying out its various functions and activities, Newforma Inc. collects information from
individuals and external organizations’ and generates a wide range of data/information which is recorded.
These records can take many different forms, such as:
```
```
 Letters received from third parties
 Copy letters which have been sent out
 Personnel records
 Invoices
 Completed application forms
 Financial records
 Contact lists
 Contracts
 Email communications and attachments
 Photos
```
```
Many of the above documents or records can be retained as physical paper records or in electronic form.
```

Retention of specific documents may be necessary to:

```
 Fulfil statutory or other regulatory requirements.
 Evidence events/agreements in the case of disputes.
 Meet operational needs.
 Ensure the preservation of documents of historic or other value.
```
The untimely destruction of documents could cause Newforma Inc.:

```
 Operational problems.
 Difficulty in defending litigious claims.
```
 Reputational damage.
 Failure to comply with the Data Protection Act 1998 and its amendments.
 Failure to comply with the EU / US Privacy Shield agreements as of July 12th 2016.
Conversely, the permanent retention of all documents is undesirable, and appropriate disposal is to be
encouraged for the following reasons:

```
 To avoid unnecessary/excessive use of storage space (electronic or physical).
 Indefinite retention of personal data may be unlawful.
 Reduction of fire risk (in the case of paper records).
 To keep records and office accommodation de-cluttered.
```
Good practice in records management emphasizes the importance of organizations’ having in place
systems for the timely and secure disposal of documents/records that are no longer required for business
purposes.

## 2.0 POLICY STANDARDS

The purpose of this policy is to provide an organization-wide policy framework to govern management
decisions on whether a particular document (or set of documents, including electronic versions) should
either be:

```
 Retained – and if so in what format, and for what period; or
 Disposed of - and if so when and by what method.
```
For the avoidance of any doubt, this policy is not concerned with the disposal/retention of unused
materials (e.g. stocks of paper, unused forms, unused badge stock)


## 3.0 The Retention / Disposal protocol

Any decision whether to retain or dispose of a document should be taken in accordance with the
retention/disposal protocol and its Information classification. This protocol consists of:

 The key disposal/retention considerations criteria checklist, set out in Appendix II of this
document. Essentially no document should be disposed of unless all these have been considered
in relation to the document.
 The Retention Schedules (taken from the Records Management Society) contained in Appendix II
These provide guidance on recommended and mandatory minimum retention periods for specific
classes of documents/records.
Where a retention period has expired in relation to a particular document or record a review should
always be carried out before a final decision is made to dispose of that document. Such reviews need not
necessarily be detailed or time consuming.

In the event that a decision is taken to dispose of a particular document or set of documents, then
consideration should be given to the method of disposal (see section 4 below).

## 4.0 Disposal of documents/records

A separate policy describes Newforma Inc.’s policy regarding secure disposal of confidential information.

As guidance however, staff should take into account the following considerations when selecting any
method of disposal:

```
 Under no circumstances should paper documents or removable media (CDs, DVDs, discs, Hard
drives etc.) containing personal data or confidential information be simply thrown or deposited in
refuse bins. To do so could result in the unauthorized disclosure of such information to third
parties, and render Newforma Inc. liable to action under the Data Protection Act and Privacy
Shield responsibilities. Such documents should be destroyed on site (e.g. by shredding) or placed
in “Confidential Waste” refuse bins.
 Deletion – the Information Commissioner’s Office has advised that if steps are taken to make
data virtually impossible to retrieve, then this will be regarded as equivalent to deletion.
 Recycling – wherever practical, disposal should further recycling, in-line with Newforma Inc.’s
commitment to the environment.
```
## 5.0 Document retention and the Data Protection Act 1998 and

## Privacy Shield.

Staff should be aware that under the Data Protection Act and Privacy Shield agreements, personal data
processed for any purpose must not be kept for longer than is necessary for that purpose. In other words,
retaining documents or records that contain personal data beyond the length of time necessary for the
purpose for which that data was obtained is unlawful.


The Data Protection Legislation contains no interpretive provisions on this provision. It is a matter for
reasonable judgement and common sense as to how long personal data should be retained.

Clearly, in many instances the retention of personal data will be necessary and thus justified for a
significant period of time. In general, provided there is adherence to this Policy, few problems should
arise.

## 6.0 How long should I store emails?

Not only does the storage of large numbers of emails consume valuable computer resources but if the
saved messages refer to individuals then they are also likely to be governed by the Data Protection Act
1998 or the EU / US Privacy Shield agreements. This means that the subject of the message may have
the right to request access to the email. Increasingly law courts are also asking organizations to compile
data held in the form of emails as evidence in tribunals and other court cases. Emails should therefore not
be retained for longer than is absolutely necessary.

As a rule of thumb, emails should be deleted after 6 months unless it is necessary to retain them for
longer.

Further guidance on the retention of documents and electronic records is available from the Legal
Department, the Information Security Department, the IT Department, or the role responsible for Business
Management. The IT Department can also advise you on good housekeeping practices regarding the
storing and deleting of emails.

## Appendix I: Key disposal/retention considerations criteria checklist

1. Has the document/record set been appraised?

As a first step, the nature/contents of any documents or records being considered for disposal should be
ascertained. No document(s) should be earmarked or designated for disposal unless this has been done.
Insofar as existing documents or records are concerned it follows that the above can only be achieved by
inspection. The process may only take a few moments.

Nonetheless it can be a skilled task - depending on the complexity of the document(s) concerned – and
should only be undertaken by staff who possess sufficient operational knowledge to enable them to
identify the document concerned and its function within Newforma Inc. Any decision to the effect that
future documents of a specified description be disposed of on expiry of a specified retention period should
be an informed one i.e. taken with a full appreciation and understanding of the nature and function of the
document/records and the classification value.

The above is largely common sense, and hardly needs to be stated. However, if appraisal is inadvertently
overlooked or carried out negligently, or by an employee who lacks the necessary background
operational knowledge, Newforma Inc. runs the risk of important documents being destroyed in error. All
Newforma employees can refer to the company Information Classification policy for the definitions that
help appraise each type of document and its contents.

2. Is retention required to fulfil statutory or other regulatory requirements?

There is very little specific legislation that stipulates mandatory retention periods for documents held by
Newforma Inc. However, staff should seek advice if they believe that there may be legislation which,


either directly or indirectly, imposes minimum retention periods on the documents they are handling. For
instance, minimum retention periods for certain financial records may be applicable.

3. Is retention required to evidence events in the case of dispute?

On rare occasions, Newforma Inc. may become involved in disputes with third parties. Such disputes, if
not satisfactorily resolved, can result in reputational damage and the dissatisfied party potentially bringing
legal proceedings against Newforma Inc. Conversely, Newforma Inc. may wish to institute legal
proceedings against an individual or organization, e.g. to recover an unpaid debt, or in respect of faulty
workmanship.

Where a dispute arises, or litigation has been commenced it is important that Newforma Inc. has access
to all correspondence and other documentation that is relevant to the matter.

The Limitations Act of 1980 specifies time limits for commencing litigation. The starting point therefore, is
that the retention period is the length of time that has to elapse before a claim is barred. The majority of
potential legal claims are statute barred on the expiry of 6 years. For this reason, many organizations
consider it prudent to retain files/records for a period of 6 years form the date when the subject matter
was completed.

It is important, though, to keep in mind that in the course of Newforma Inc. everyday business large
masses of document action are generated that serve no purpose after relatively short periods of time.
Many documents will relate to completed matters where, realistically, the risk of subsequent litigation or
other dispute is minimal, if not non-existent. Long-term retention of such documents is counterproductive.
Staff should be prepared to carry out a risk analysis, with a view to disposal of such documents within a
shorter period of than the 6 years’ time frame.

4. Is retention required to meet the operational needs of Newforma Inc.?

In some cases, retention may be desirable (whether permanent or otherwise) even though no minimum
retention period applies or has expired. Staff should be aware of the risk of discarding documents or
records that might be useful for future reference purposes (e.g. training), as precedents, or for
performance management (performance indicators, benchmarking and comparison exercises). A
professional judgement needs to be made as to the usefulness of a particular document.

5. Is retention required because the document or record is of historic interest or intrinsic value?

In most cases this consideration will not be applicable. However, it is possible that some
documents/records may be of historic interest.

Where it is suspected that the document falls within this description appropriate enquires should always
be made before taking any further action. The Vice President of IT or the Vice President of Business
Management should be contacted for advice and guidance in the first instance.

Even if the document is of historical or monetary value, disposal rather than retention by Newforma Inc.,
may well be the appropriate option (e.g. by way of transfer to a third party).
