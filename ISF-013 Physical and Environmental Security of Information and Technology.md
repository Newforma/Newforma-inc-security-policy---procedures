## 1. POLICY STATEMENT

Newforma has a responsibility to manage and protect information held and processed on its computer assets and associated equipment in its Data Centers, in Computer and Communications Rooms, in other designated secure areas, and in general offices and workplaces. 

This policy will help to reduce exposure to the following risks: 

* Unauthorized access to sensitive information held at major data processing centers 
* Disclosure or theft of sensitive information held at major data processing centers 
* Damage to equipment due to lack of protection from environmental factors 
* Disruption of business activities due to lack of protection from environmental factors 
* Inadequate safety of employees 

Datacenters, Computer and/or Communications Rooms and other designated secure areas should be afforded appropriate security measures commensurate with their risk and value to protect these facilities, the equipment and information from external risks including environmental factors as well as physical criminal attack.
